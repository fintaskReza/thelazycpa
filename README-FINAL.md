3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Generate new app password for "Mail"

**Step 2:** Add to Vercel (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "thelazycpa" project
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Click "Environment Variables" in left menu
5. Add these 6 variables:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| SMTP_HOST | smtp.gmail.com |
| SMTP_PORT | 587 |
| SMTP_SECURE | false |
| SMTP_USER | reza@fintask.ie |
| SMTP_PASS | [your 16-char app password] |

6. Click "Save"
7. The site will auto-redeploy

**Step 3:** Test

### Option B: If fintask.ie uses different email provider

Check with your provider for:

- Port (usually 587)
- Whether SSL/TLS is needed

Then add the same 6 environment variables with your provider's settings.

## 📊 LINKEDIN POST (Ready to Copy)

```
2 years ago I didn't know what an API key was.

I thought coding was for "real developers" with CS degrees.

Then I learned:
• An API key is just a password for apps
• The terminal is just texting your computer
• JSON is just labeled boxes
• GitHub is just Google Drive for code

That's it. That's the secret.

99% of AI/automation isn't complex math.
It's learning 12 basic concepts and combining them creatively.

So I made a guide that explains all 12 in simple language (like you're 5).

👇 Comment "GUIDE" and I'll send it to you personally

## 💬 DM SCRIPT (Copy-Paste)

```
Hey [Name]!

Thanks for commenting! Here's the guide:
https://thelazycpa.vercel.app/AI-Automation-101.html

It's 37 pages of the 12 concepts I wish I knew when I started.

Quick question: What are you working on building right now? Always curious what fellow vibe coders are up to!
